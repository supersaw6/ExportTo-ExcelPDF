# ExportTo-ExcelPDF
This script lets you create a PDF of the "Daily Summary" tab in every Daily Report excel file recursively.

This script can also redo old PDF's in the folders.



**How to use:**

Open the folder where your daily report excel files are stored. Make sure these files are the files you want to PDF.

Right click in the folder and click "Open in Terminal"

Once you are in the terminal make sure you are using windows powershell

Then paste in this code that runs the ExportTo-ExcelPDF

`powershell.exe -file "scriptpath.ps1"`

Replace the scriptpath with the actual path whre the script is located. I have it located in `J:\Engineering\Data Management\Scripts\ExportTo-ExcelPDF.ps1`

Once you replace the scriptpath with the actual path, press enter and the script will prompt you to do things.
